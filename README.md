### The Trivia Game for everytime you've seen an actor and wondered aloud, *"Wait, who's that guy again?"*

Join the fun with this interactive quiz game that endulges that deepest itch of not quite being able to put your finger on where you've seen that guy before. This time, with Star Trek characters! Some of these roles are one off cameos, some are recurring characters, but they all have one thing in common: You've seen that freaking guy before, what's his name again?

### Goals

1. The user should load the page with the basic framing of the game intact, explaining that there will be 10 questions, but with a large "start" button in place of the Q/A section.
2. Once the "start" button has been clicked, the users score should be set to zero and a timer of 60 seconds should start. The photo section should populate with the first image of the first actor. The Q/A section should populate with the first question, set of four possible answers, as well as a submit button.
3. The user should be able to click any of the answers to select them, as well as be able to change their mind before hitting the submit button.
4. When the submit button is clicked, the site should check if the answer is correct, add to the tally of correct answers, congratulate the user briefly for guessing correctly OR show correct answer briefly if answered incorrectly, and populate the Q/A and image with the next question.
5. When the user clicks submit on the 10th question, the Q/A section should populate a message declaring different Star Trek ranks, depending on wether they answered 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, or 10 questions correctly. There should be accompanying sound effects and visual effects, depending on which rank they acquire. 
6. The user should be able to hit a "restart game" button to try again and re-initialize the page.
